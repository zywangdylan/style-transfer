## Style Transfer of Images and Videos

In this repository, we implement style transfer and analyze various design choices in the algorithm, which is impor- tant for learning from the artistic styles of existing artworks and generating new visually pleasing results. We implement two versions of style transfer. The first version requires a long runtime for images with high resolution. We explore many possible solutions and implement the second version that provides a significant speedup. We are able to efficiently stylize high resolution on GPU and scale up to stylizing videos, which requires transforming a large number of frames of the videos.
